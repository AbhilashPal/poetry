this is the concept for a short story so here goes:
The story is going to involve a multiverse,of course that will be the big reveal in the climax.It is going to feature around 4 or 5 women all with their 
own plots,situations and devices,but the time period or the period of occurence will have to be skillfully concealed,or just given subtle hints at..should not be guessed easily.
First:
A young woman in 20s,at a beach,gazing at the sunset...she looks back at her resort...
Second:A married couple on their honeymoon.At the resort,they gaze into the sunset together and the wife speaks of how much she loved the place and what she could sacrifice to go there every once in a while,sit at the beach and marvel at the wonderous beauty of nature.
[sublte hints about the appearance and a specific possession that should appear with the first girl as well but not certain about belonging to her.]
Third:A woman in her mansion,playing with her children and trying to put them to sleep,she falls asleep as well...she tiresomely raises her eyes to look at the time and that certain possesion catches her eye but not enough to keep her awake
Fourt:An old woman..living alone,going to bed,she smiles as she tkaes a roller coaster through her memories,what a trip!And then disaster,she dies all of a sudden.
Somewhere far away,a wom,an is awakened by her husband..she sees that all her children are already ut of bed,she smiles and kisses her spouse..and says:"Honey,I dreamed that i was old!"
The married couple :Dream of children
The teenager:A hope of coming back to the beach.
The object or object and the entire detailing should be very specific and visual,the timeline join should be hinted upon.
