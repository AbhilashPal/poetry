Hestian spring and dreams of sorrow
A joy today is a joy tomorrow.
Scarce can silver and gold conjure
What can art and love, in a heart so pure.
Breathe the air that silent still,
Flows in health to afford weal,
Mere fancy, 'tis not I daresay, presumably
Life offers more, if more, you see,
We undertake in this brief moment,
Since a life fulfilled is a life well spent.
Strength in blood and bones held taut
A noble life is scarcely got
In this fairytale of ignorance,we cohabit-
The filth and pride of earth exhibit,
Merciless, the wife of space, time
Is limited, by death, such as our prime
If we have one, may it be so,
Not encumbered by an eternal flow.
